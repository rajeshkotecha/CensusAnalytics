# US Census Data Analytics
The main idea behind this project is as follows -

Using US Census and local business data to calculate various metrics that will help businesses find most suitable locations to expand their operations. 

# Purpose and Use Cases
Often businesses are looking for opportunities to expand their operations and grow top line as well as bottom line. If a business is a chain of restaurants or stores one of the options to grow is to add new locations. But adding a new location can be an expensive endeavor. The business should carefully evaluate potential opportunities available in the new location. They need to know whether there would be enough demand for their services or products and also the people living in the area have sufficient purchasing power. To evaluate the potential of an area for their business they need to know the demographics and income levels of people.
